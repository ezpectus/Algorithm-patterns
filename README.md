# Algorithm Patterns 📚🚀

This repository is my personal library of **coding patterns** — reusable algorithmic approaches that can be applied to solve multiple problems on platforms like **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, **HackerRank**, or in real-world projects.  

The main goal is to **understand, memorize, and quickly recognize** these patterns during problem-solving, instead of relying on random guesswork.

## Why I Created This Repository 💡

I've solved hundreds of algorithmic problems, but noticed a repeating truth:
> Many problems are just variations of the same core patterns.

The real skill isn't just *solving* one problem — it's recognizing **the underlying technique** instantly, and applying it in your own style.

This repo is designed to:
- Build my personal **algorithmic muscle memory** 🧠
- Document patterns with **clear explanations**
- Provide **multiple code implementations** for each pattern
- Categorize patterns for quick navigation
- Create a long-term reference for myself and others

---

## Structure 🗂️

Each pattern has:
1. **README section** explaining:
   - When to use the pattern
   - Time/space complexity
   - Common pitfalls
2. **Example problems** (3–5 per pattern)
3. **Solutions** in C# (my main language), sometimes with Python/Java for comparison
4. **Pattern Variations** if applicable

### Example Pattern: Sliding Window

**When to use:**
- Problems involving subarrays/substrings
- Optimizing repeated range calculations
- Fixed-size or dynamic ranges

**Advantages:**
- Reduces O(n²) solutions to O(n)
- Simplifies logic for continuous segments

**Common mistakes:**
- Forgetting to update the window after moving pointers
- Not handling edge cases (empty arrays, single elements)

**Example Problems:**
- Find the maximum sum of k consecutive elements
- Longest substring without repeating characters
- Minimum size subarray sum

## How to Use This Repo 🛠️

1. **Pick a pattern** from the list
2. Read the **theory & common use cases**
3. Go through the **example problems**
4. Implement them **without looking at the solution**
5. Compare with my solution & note any improvements

## Future Plans 🚀

- Expand examples for competitive programming
- Add a **"micro patterns"** section (tiny reusable tricks)
- Compare performance of different approaches for the same problem

## About Me 👨‍💻

I'm a developer focused on mastering algorithms and data structures, not just for interview prep, but to be able to **solve any problem from scratch, in my own way**.  
This repository is a key part of that journey.
