## ✅ Supported Versions

All versions of this project are actively supported with security updates.  
Why? Because I personally maintain every line and understand exactly how it works — top to bottom.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | ✅ Fully supported  |
| 5.0.x   | ✅ Fully supported  |
| 4.0.x   | ✅ Fully supported  |
| < 4.0   | ✅ Fully supported  |

> 🔧 No legacy. No abandonware.  
> 🧠 I know what’s under the hood — and I keep it clean.

Whether you're using the latest release or something older, you're covered.  
Security is not outsourced here — it's **architected and enforced by me**.


## 🛡️ Why This Project Is Resilient

This project is built and maintained by **one person — me**.  
I don’t rely on teams, committees, or corporate pipelines.  
I rely on **clarity, precision, and a deep respect for the community**.

It’s designed to be **free of critical errors and vulnerabilities**, not just through technical rigor — but through **educational clarity**.

I help others understand complex systems by:

- ✅ Translating advanced ideas into **simple, example-driven language**
- ✅ Teaching the community to **master hard concepts without confusion**
- ✅ Documenting every algorithm with **transparent, architectural logic**
- ✅ Building tools that help people **learn, not just copy**

> When you understand what you're building, you build it safer.  
> And I make sure you understand.

This project doesn’t just avoid bugs — it **prevents them by design**.  
Because I don’t just write code — I **architect understanding**.

## 🤝 Community-Driven Security

I support learners and contributors by:

- Providing **architectural explanations** for every algorithm  
- Offering **real-world examples** to demystify abstract logic  
- Reviewing everything for **clarity, correctness, and educational value**

> Security isn’t just a checklist — it’s a mindset.  
> And I teach it through every line of code.
